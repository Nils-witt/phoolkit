PhoolKit
========

Description
-----------

A loose set of PHP classes (PHP 5.3 or higher) which can be used to make
developing PHP web applications easier. PhoolKit is *not* a framework. It
doesn't dictate how you structure you web application and doesn't limit you
in any way. If you only want to use a tiny bit of PhoolKit (like form
validation) then simply ignore the rest.


Features
--------

* Form validation (Client-side and Server-side)
* View helper functions
* (More to come...)
